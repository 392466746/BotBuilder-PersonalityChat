## Small talk using QnAMaker
If your chatbot is already using [QnAMaker cognitive service](https://qnamaker.ai) for powering a knowledge base of question-answers, you can import the small talk query dataset *Queries_Responses_QnAMaker.tsv*. Note that since QnAMaker does not support multiple answers for a single query i.e. randomized responses, this dataset picks one small talk response for each scenario. You can edit the responses directly in the [QnAMaker management portal.](https://qnamaker.ai)
